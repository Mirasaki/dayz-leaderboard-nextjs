This is a DayZ leaderboard website created with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org) using data collected and provided by the [CFTools Data API](https://app.cftools.cloud/). Originally funded by TwoPigs from [The Traveller](https://discord.gg/thetraveller) who's always looking to give to the community, here it is, open-source and ready for you to host.

## ‚ú® Demo

A demo deployment showcasing this project can be found [here](https://leaderboard.mirasaki.dev/)

## ü§© Features

- Shows the top 100 leaderboard for your DayZ server
- Query by in-game name **or** Steam64/CFTools ID if you're not on the leaderboard
- Display detailed player statistics
- Very customizable, from theming to branding - there's a configuration value to customize it to your wants and needs
- Manual single and multiple server configuration, or automatically resolve server grants directly from the CFTools API
- Social media previews (and directly rich Search Engine Optimization) to preview your community

## üöÄ Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

**TLDR:** Fork the repo, authorize Vercel to manage your fork and watch it deploy the site to a live domain for you.

## üî® Installation

1. Download and extract [the latest release](https://github.com/Mirasaki/dayz-leaderboard-nextjs/releases) and navigate to the newly created folder
2. Rename `.env.example` to `.env` (make sure displaying file extensions is enabled) and fill in your configuration. The **only** required variables are:
    - `CFTOOLS_API_APPLICATION_ID`: Application ID from your [CFTools Developer Apps](https://developer.cftools.cloud/applications) - Authorization has to be granted by navigating to the `Grant URL` that's displayed in your app overview
    - `CFTOOLS_API_SECRET`: Same as above, click `Reveal Secret`
    - `CFTOOLS_SERVER_API_ID`: Click `Manage Server` in your [CF Cloud Panel](https://app.cftools.cloud/dashboard) > `Settings` > `API Key` > `Server ID`
3. Rename `config.example.json` to `config.json` and customize the project to your hearts content
4. Run the following commands in this exact order:

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build

# Start the project
npm run start
```

The project is now available on [port 3002](http://localhost:3002/). This is only available on your local network.

To allow anyone to reach your website basic knowledge of web-servers (like [Apache](https://apache.org/) or [Nginx](https://nginx.org/en/)) is required.

- An example Nginx file is included for your convenience [here](/nginx.example.conf).
- With this conf Nginx serves all static assets, if these fail to load (like no styles applied to the website) use the [minimal conf instead](/nginx.min.conf)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

This project was initially funded by [The Traveller](https://discord.gg/thetraveller) and their configuration and branding will be used throughout the project.

### .env

```bash
# CFTools API Credentials - The ONLY required values here
# CFTOOLS_SERVER_API_ID will only be used AS THE DEFAULT
# when using multiple server setup in the config file
CFTOOLS_API_APPLICATION_ID=
CFTOOLS_API_SECRET=
CFTOOLS_SERVER_API_ID=

# Runtime Environment - production/development/staging
NODE_ENV=production

# Development-only - Analyze the app bundle
ANALYZE=true

# If provided, uses these values for the og:image meta tag (discord embed link previews)
# If omitted, uses your branding logo from the config file as a small image
NEXT_PUBLIC_IMAGE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_LARGE_OG_IMAGE=false
```

### config.json

> These are the default values with a bit of an explanation, but comments (lines starting with `//` are **not** valid in JSON - so don't copy-paste this into your live application. This is but a reference.)

*Values marked with `(*)` use static files that are automatically served from the `/public` folder. If you change `BRANDING_LOGO_FILE_NAME` to `logo.jpeg`, that file should exist in the `/public` folder*

‚ùó**Don't use this! Use the [example configuration](/config.example.json) file instead** ‚ùó
